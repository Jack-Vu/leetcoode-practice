Arrays hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. In arrays, we are usually worried about two things position/index
of an element and the element itself. 

Advantages:
Stores multiple elements of the same type in one single variable name
Access elements fast with index versus linked list where you have to transverse from the head

Disadvantages:
Addition and removal of elements into/from middle of array is slow since remaining elements need to be shifted to accommodate (unless added/removed from end)
Certain languages array size is fixed and if the size increase a new array is created and existing elements copied over (JS not fixed)

Common terms:
Subarray - range of continuous values within an array
[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 6, 1] is a subarray 

Subsequence- A sequence that can be derived from a given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements
[2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 1, 5] is a subsequence

Things to look out for during interviews:
Clarify duplicate values in the array. Would presence of dup values affect answer? Does it make question simpler or harder?
When iterating through an array be careful not to go out of bounds
Be careful about slicing or concatenating arrays use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray/range when possible
