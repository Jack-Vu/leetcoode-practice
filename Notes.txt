Javascript has primitive (built in) and non-primitive (not built in) data structures

Primitive data structures come by default when programming lang and can be implemented out of the box (array and object)
Non-primitive data structures don't come by default and you need to code them to use them

Arrays

an array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations
each item can be accessed through their index starting at index 0 
they have a length property to define the number of elements it contains
in JS arrays can store values of any type in the same array and the length is dynamic
you can have multidimensional arrays
when adding/deleting from the middle or beginning of an array forces indexes of all the elements that come after to be chnages
this is a computational cost and is one of the weakness of this DS

Objects (Hash tables)
