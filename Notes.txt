Javascript has primitive (built in) and non-primitive (not built in) data structures

Primitive data structures come by default when programming lang and can be implemented out of the box (array and object)
Non-primitive data structures don't come by default and you need to code them to use them

Arrays

an array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations
each item can be accessed through their index starting at index 0 
they have a length property to define the number of elements it contains
in JS arrays can store values of any type in the same array and the length is dynamic
you can have multidimensional arrays
when adding/deleting from the middle or beginning of an array forces indexes of all the elements that come after to be chnages
this is a computational cost and is one of the weakness of this DS

Objects (Hash tables)

an object is a collection of key-value pairs this structure is called map, dictionary or hash-table 
each key as t obe unique within an object and you cant have two keys with the same name
objects can store both values and functions
values are called properties and functions are called methods
to access properties you can use two different syntaxes object.property or object["property"] to access methods we call object.method()
assigning new values is pretty straight forward
obj.prop4 =125
obj.["prop5"] = "something"
obj.prop6 = () => function
objects are a good way to group together data with something in common or somehow related
